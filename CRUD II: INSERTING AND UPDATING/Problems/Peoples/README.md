# MongoDB Practice Problems

This repository contains a set of 10 MongoDB practice problems, along with a collection of 10 sample documents to use in solving these problems. These problems are designed to help you practice common MongoDB operations, such as inserting documents, updating fields, and querying data.

## Sample Documents

The following documents are included in the `sample_documents.json` file:

```[  
{  
"_id": {"$oid": "615d5f5c91f2b4d1d00d6dfe"},  
"name": "Alice",  
"age": 27,  
"email": "alice@example.com",  
"hobbies": ["reading", "cooking"]  
},  
{  
"_id": {"$oid": "615d5f5c91f2b4d1d00d6dff"},
"name": "Bob",
"age": 35,
"email": "bob@example.com",
"hobbies": ["running", "swimming", "yoga"]
},
...
]
```
